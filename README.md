# ljwm

A toolset allowing you to make your own window manager. When it works, that is.

It is basically LuaJIT plus xcb bindings and wrappers.

It's written mostly in Lua with some C glue, quite little.

# Dependencies
A C compiler, XCB, LuaJIT and some luck.

# Credits
Me, for doing many things.
William Adams, for [LJIT2XCB](https://github.com/Wiladams/LJIT2XCB), from which I have stolen a lot of code for the xcb bindings.
The wrappers, however, are mine.
